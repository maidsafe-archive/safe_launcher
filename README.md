## Installation
The development dependency of this project is [Node.js v6.5.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v6.0.0/).
Build [safe_core version 0.23.0](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_client_libs) with the mock Routing feature:
 
```
cargo build --release --features use-mock-routing
```
 
then copy the resulting shared library (`safe_core.dll` for Windows, `libsafe_core.so` for Linux or `libsafe_core.dylib` for OS X) to the `app/ffi` folder of this project.

The launcher can be developed/tested only with ffi with mock feature or by running a local network only.


```
npm install
```

### Rebuild native dependencies

```
$ npm run rebuild-native
```
