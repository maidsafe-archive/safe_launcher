<span class='doccomment'>//! Client and node implementations for a resilient decentralised network.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The network is based on the [kademlia_routing_table][1] and uses the XOR metric to define the</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! &quot;distance&quot; between two [`XorName`][2]s. `XorName`s are used as addresses of nodes, clients as</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! well as data.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! [1]: ../kademlia_routing_table/index.html</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! [2]: ../xor_name/struct.XorName.html</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Messages are exchanged between _authorities_, where an `Authority` can be an</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! individual client or node, or a group of nodes. In both cases, messages are cryptographically</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! signed by the sender, and in the latter case it is verified that a sufficient number of group</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! members agree on the message: Only if that quorum is reached, the message is delivered. In</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! addition, each message has a unique ID, and is delivered only once.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Group authorities are also addressed using a single `XorName`. The members of that group are</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! the nodes that are closest to that name. Since nodes are assigned their name by the network,</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! this provides redundancy and resilience: A node has no control over which group authorities it</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! will be a member of, and without a majority in the group it cannot forge a message from that</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! group.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The library also provides different types for the messages&#39; data. The data types are encoded</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! with Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR).</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ## Usage</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! A decentralised service based on the `routing` library uses `Client` to send requests to the</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! network of nodes and receive responses.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! `Node` is used to handle and send requests within that network, and to implement its</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! functionality, e. g. storing and retrieving data, validating permissions, managing metadata etc.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! # Client creation</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! A client&#39;s name is a hash of its public keys. Upon creation, the client will attempt to connect</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! to the network through any node, and exchange public keys with it. That node becomes a</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! bootstrap node for the client, and messages to and from the client will be routed over it.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ```</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! use std::sync::mpsc;</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! use routing::{Client, Event, FullId};</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel::&lt;Event&gt;();</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! let full_id = FullId::new(); // Generate new keys.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! let client = Client::new(sender, Some(full_id.clone())).unwrap();</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! let client_name = full_id.public_id().name();</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ```</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Messages can be sent using the methods of `client`, and received as `Event`s from the</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! `receiver`.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! # Node creation</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Creating a node looks even simpler:</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ```</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! use std::sync::mpsc;</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! use routing::{Node, Event};</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel::&lt;Event&gt;();</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! let node = Node::new(sender).unwrap();</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ```</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Upon creation, the node will first connect to the network as a client. Once it has client</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! status, it requests a new name from the network, and then integrates itself in the network with</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! that new name, adding close nodes to its routing table.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Messages can be sent using the methods of `node`, and received as `Event`s from the `receiver`.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The node can act as an individual node or as part of a group authority. Sending a message as a</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! group authority only has an effect if sufficiently many other nodes in that authority send the</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! same message.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! # Example: Put message flow for immutable data</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! An example implementation of a vault for storing and retrieving `ImmutableData` is included</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! with the code of this library. The flow of a `Put` request there moves through the following</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! authorities:</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! * A `Client` that wants to store a piece of data on the network.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! * The `ClientManager` group authority that is responsible for that particular client. The nodes</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! in this group have access to metadata about this client and can e. g. verify that it has</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! required permissions or quota to store the data. The `ClientManager`&#39;s address is the `XorName`</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! of the client itself, so it consists of the nodes closest to that name.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! * The `NaeManager` group authority which is responsible for that particular piece of data and</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! knows where in the network it should be stored. Its address is the `XorName` of the data.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! * The `ManagedNode`s are the individual nodes that actually store the data. This could be just</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! one, but let&#39;s assume that data is stored redundantly in more than one place.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The message flow from the client to the managed nodes looks like this:</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! * The client sends a `Put` request to the `ClientManager`, i. e. the sender is the individual</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! `Client` and the receiver is a group of nodes with addresses close to the client&#39;s name.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! * Each node in the `ClientManager` group performs validation and updates metadata (which may</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! involve further messages not considered in this example). If valid, it sends a `PutSuccess`</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! response back to the client, and a `Put` request to the `NaeManager` with the data&#39;s `XorName`.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! In both cases, the sender is the `ClientManager`, not the individual node.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! * Each node in the `NaeManager` chooses a number of individual nodes that are responsible for</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! storing this specific piece of data. This needs to happen in a deterministic way so that the</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! members of the `NaeManager` agree on the responsible nodes. Then they finally send a `Put`</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! request to each of these. Here the sender is the `NaeManager`, but the recipient is the</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! individual `ManagedNode`.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! * Each `ManagedNode` locally stores the data.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! These steps need to be implemented by the user of the library. Each node needs to handle all</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! these cases, as it can be simultaneously a `ManagedNode` and a member of several different</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! `ClientManager`s and `NaeManager`s. A client, however, does not act as a node or vice versa.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Transparently to the user, the `routing` library deals with message quora, so the user will only</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! receive a message from a `Client` or `Node` if it was either sent</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! * by a client or individual node, or</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! * by a sufficient number of members of a group authority.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>

                <h2>Search Tricks</h2>

                <p>
                    Prefix searches with a type followed by a colon (e.g.
                    <code>fn:</code>) to restrict the search to a given type.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Accepted types are: <code>fn</code>, <code>mod</code>,
                    <code>struct</code>, <code>enum</code>,
                    <code>trait</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>macro</code>,
                    and <code>const</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Search functions by type signature (e.g.
                    <code>vec -> usize</code>)
                </p>
